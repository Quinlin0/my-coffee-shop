          <h2>MUGG & BREW</h2>
          <p>Mug & Brew was founded By Mike as he felt their was much more to just selling coffee,
            or buying a cup and going on your way.He felt like it could be more of a place where 
            you can bring friends and family to experience a bit of home away from home.
            Where each of our delicious items is prepared freash everyday for you and family to enjoy.</p>
